# Crawler-Challenge
I'll do my best to explain my thought process on the Crawler here.

12\05 - After my homework for my Python class (On my other repository) i've got more practice and understanding on how to use Print/Input and If/Else.
Searching for the Definition of a Web Crawler, i've seen These websites (and more) :

https://www.webfx.com/blog/internet/what-is-a-web-crawler/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler.

It seems a Crawler that focuses on Retrieving information from a specific Database is called a Web Scraper, that'll help me search more about it.

Installed additional tools that'll be useful for making the crawler, Request, BeautifulSoup and pandas.
