# Crawler-Challenge
I'll do my best to explain my thought process on the Crawler here.

After my homework for my Python class (On my other repository) i've got more practice and understanding on how to use Print/Input and If/Else.
Searching for the Definition of a Web Crawler, i've seen These websites (and more) :

https://www.webfx.com/blog/internet/what-is-a-web-crawler/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler.

It seems a Crawler that focuses on Retrieving information from a specific Database is called a Web Scraper, that'll help me search more about it.

Installed additional tools that'll be useful for making the crawler: Request, BeautifulSoup and pandas.

After looking around on various guides, i managed to get good progress for today, i have classes now so i'll keep doing this tomorrow.
next step it seems is to set up a Loop so i can make it read the other pages as well, and then obviously, extracting the actual information i want from the stuff,
otherwise, good pace today.

After days of trial and error, i managed to replicate the Crawler from the guides i was following, but trying to use that knowledge to create one for another website 
is giving me trouble, trying to fix the HTTP i get from the website i chose, it seems like it's getting a different HTTP than the page i wanted.
